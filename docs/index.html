                      <h5>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).</h5>
                      <p>I started my interest in IT as a gamer during primary school. Playing mobile games becomes my hobby ever since my first try. However, the novelty to continue playing a particular game wears off quickly, resulting in me trying a lot of games along the way. After a few try, I had the idea of developing my very own games which suit my aesthetic. Since then, I did some research and found myself interested in the game design and development. The only imperfection is that science subjects are the only focus in our high school education leaving IT a brand new field yet to be discovered and learned later on which much more increases the difficulty of me mastering it.

                      <h5>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h5>
                      <p>I decided to study abroad as IT degrees in my country are not that popular and does not value much when applying for jobs. Melbourne city is my choice as my sister is working here and can lend me a hand in coping with new study and living environment. After much research, RMIT and Melbourne University are my top choice as they all achieve high ranks in the QS World University Rankings. RMIT is my final choice as being awarded an overall 5 QS Stars in eight out of eight categories, it has no doubt the top-notch teaching qualities, equipment and facilities. However, the most important factor is it offers a more affordable price in IT degree and located in Melbourne Central which provides easy transport is the icing on the cake.

                      <h5>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h5>
                      <p>The demand for skilled IT industry professionals across Australia and overseas is huge. That also means itâ€™s highly competitive. To increase my employment chance, I believe it is crucial to work in all facets of IT including software engineering, computer programming, web design and development, cybersecurity and system analysis. My main expectation for this degree is to deliver knowledge on programming principles, skills and practices for modern software development. I am also convinced that gaining knowledge of the processes and associated tools required to service the software development lifecycle will post a great advantage in my future job positions which highly demand team collaboration.

                      <p>Riot Games, Inc. being the one of the greatest video game developers is definitely the ideal place to proceed with my career. Since I am a fan of online multiplayer games, League of Legends is my all-time favourite video games so I would want to pursue as a Engineering Manager of League Content Efficiency. I believe my passion in character and game content design pretty much suits this position and most importantly working under a desired environment contributes to a long run career although it can be stressful sometimes. Besides that, this position enables me to showcase my outstanding leadership and creativity in supporting my team and planning future patch to serve long-term goals. The job has its perks, including offers medical, dental, and vision plans that cover me, my spouse and children.

                      <br>
                      <p>This position requires a bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science or a related field, or equivalent experience. One should have at least 3 years of working experience in an engineering leadership position on a team shipping large large-scale, modular desktop applications and at least 6 years of software engineering experience. Furthermore, experience in developing software desktop applications with a heavy emphasis on data management and experience in one of the following programming languages: C/C++, Java, Go, C# are also part of the requirements for this job.

                      <br>
                      <p>I am currently a third-year undergraduate of bachelorâ€™s degree of Computer Science at RMIT. Along with this course, I have gained knowledge and practical skills in programming languages like python, java, php and c. Besides that, I am also experienced in working on cloud platforms such as google app engine and AWS. Furthermore, I have acquired basic knowledge in managing databases and graphics technologies after completing part of the core course. By participating in various group projects, I developed myself as a responsible team member and had applied AGILE practice in project development.
                      </p>
                      <br>
                      <p>To upgrade my skills and qualification, I intend to take on online programming course on those programming languages which I have not learned. Since a highflier is not a great idea in starting oneâ€™s career, I plan to start as an software engineer in small agencies in order to sharpen my skills and enrich my experience. I believe commencing my career at the bottom of the scale rewards me with deeper insight and understanding in leading teams and building plans to fulfill company goals later on.

                     <p>Based on the test results above, it clearly shows I am the introverted type of person which I fully agree with but at the same time feeling alarmed as this is not the ideal trait to proceed further in the IT industry which relies heavily on team work. Besides that, I also found me being part of a less intuitive and assertive person unfavoured my conditions where people around me does not know me well enough as I seldom communicate with them. With a slightly higher planning and tactics ability, I believe that pragmatist style is the ideal learning style for me as it implements trials and errors in term of solving problems which requires strong self-conscientiousness and wise decision making.

                      <p>Personality tests are useful because they show individual strengths that enable me to determine where my talents are best served. By having a greater knowledge of my personality, I can discover careers and places that match my personality. This makes it easier for me to determine the types of careers that are suitable for myself through examining the test results. Besides that, align the personality scores with potential career paths ensures that I am heading in the right direction. Reflection on the alignment after every test is also crucial as it provides knowledge of your personality traits can help you determine the types of professional and personal development that you need. For example, someone who scores low on extraversion yet is seen as having management potential would benefit from communication skills training in order to boost their skills in social interaction. After making all the shortcomings, it is necessary to consider you can best demonstrate your strengths through development and experience. For example, if you score very high on openness to experience, then consider how you can be more creative in your job. Speak to your supervisor about assignments that will demonstrate this personality trait.

                      <h5>How do I think these results may influence my behaviour in a team?</h5>
                      <p>By observing and analysing my test results, I believe it allows me to fully understand my shortcomings which may post great problems when working in a team. Being an introverted and less assertive person is definitely not a great practice in order to achieve great teamwork in fulfilling task. I recognize the need to make a change on my own behaviour by trying to sound up more in discussions and be more positive in expressing my thoughts. I plan to participate in more social activities and try to make more friends.

                      <h5>How should I take this into account when forming a team?</h5>
                      <p>Rather than putting people into pre-categorized boxes, I have faith that everyone can spark candid conversations and create all-too-important awareness around one very important factâ€”that not everyone works or thinks the same way. One of the most important conclusions drawn from personality research is that teams with a range of personalities are more likely to find success as variations of personalities had a balancing effect during team projects. For example, team members with more social and agreeable attitudes were able to help mitigate conflict and maintain team optimism, boost morale and encourage involvement during stressful situations when negative feelings are festering. As any project manager knows, complex projects contain many phases between initiation and completion while personality assessments can give project managers insight on how best to empower his team members. For example, one team member might be better at kicking off a project and getting buy-in, while another team member might be stronger when it comes to planning and details. However, our judgement should not rely fully on personality assessments, but by using the data properly, we can create more opportunities to optimize the way we work and build team communication.

                         </div>
                         <h3>Overview</h3>
                         <p>I planned to develop a project that produce an app that calculates solar energy potential of buildings and visualization using unity 3D game engine. The implementation of this solar estimation project uses CityGML LoD2-LoD3. Unity 3D Game engine with development of several customized tools and functionalities are used for modelling and analysis. The results show the estimation of potential solar energy received for the whole area per day, week, month and year which contributes to more accurate decision making for installing the solar panel. I strongly believe the Unity game engine platform could be utilized for near future 3D mapping visualization purposes instead of using it for game design purpose.</p>

                         </div>
                         <h3>Motivation</h3>
                         <p>Maps and geographic information systems (GIS) have become crucial communication, decision-making, and outreach tools for local decision-makers. Their ability to generate and disseminate knowledge have improved through the advancements in interactivity and data sharing. On the other hand, the worldwide interest in the market and technologies related to solar photovoltaic (PV) energy is increasing mostly due the increasing demand for sustainable energy production and energy security, which are aggravated by issues like climate change and environmental problems associated with the development of conventional energy resources (Fraunhofer ISE 2015). Thus, advancements to photovoltaic (PV) technologies are re-configuring stakeholder relations and bringing new social and technical challenges and opportunities to cities. As these technologies become easier to install, utilities, willingly or not, need to adapt their infrastructure and operation practices to accommodate these new forms and sites of generation. (Fish, C. S., & Calvert, K. 2017). Interactive web maps have the potential to facilitate and perhaps coordinate informed decisions within and between these stakeholder groups. Indeed, urban-scale energy resource mapping has become increasingly common, marked by the rise in online energy maps in cities across the world (Kanters et al. 2014)</p>

                         </div>
                         <h3>Description</h3>
                         <p>This project aims to develop a mobile app that estimates the potential solar energy of the selected building rooftop and generates a report based on the calculation. It serves as project management tool for installers to carry out feasibility studies, site surveys, designing and prepare techno-commercial proposals for their customers while providing feedbacks to way end customers about their approximate cost for solar panel installation, applicable government incentives, finance, and information about nearby Solar Australian PV Rooftop Installer.
                         </p>
                         <p>This app has a default map that allows users to assess solar potential. Wider implementation of solar energy systems can be achieved by implementing the function to not only view general solar potential in a location, but to calculate solar potential across a specific rooftop which may help with decision making. Users can click on any building to compare solar potential, pan and zoom around the map and assess solar potential for every structure represented on the map. It is especially helpful as opposed to those that required the user to know a specific address. This benefits solar energy developers who are interested in identifying clientsâ€™ buildings with ideal solar potential, or a utility system operator interested in identifying rooftops within a specified distance of a node on the electricity grid.
                         </p>
                         <p>Additionally, the map allows users to draw on a rooftop to assess solar potential for an isolated area of the building which enables a homeowner to assess potential on only the part of the roof where they may want to install a PV system. Clicking on the buildings on the map allows users to analyze all aspects of system potential (cost, savings, energy production, and environmental benefits). It is important as prospective investors (homeowners and third-party developers) are more motivated to deploy PV systems based on both economic and environmental benefits if site-specific information about the multiple benefits of solar are provided. In addition, cost will be the most important decision criterion for some users, while for others, savings will be the motivating factor. Another advantage of this grouping was the display of options to connect with an installer. Map users can realize the economic and environmental benefits of a system at their location of interest more easily by connecting them directly with a solar installation company or offering a list of companies. The map also allows the user to generate a report that helps in connecting users and installers. This provides information about all aspects of system potential, benefits of solar, costs, and solar installation services to users who seriously about installing a PV system which is ideal for allowing users to make the most informed decision possible.
                         </p>
                         <p>Several map interaction operators were widely used in the map of, including search, retrieve, pan, zoom, import, and calculate. The search operator likewise important because it allowed the user to easily find their home within the map without panning and zooming. This is necessary if the goal is to allow users to assess the energy potential of a particular building. The retrieve operator afforded users the ability to query the map for more information. This is crucial for users who want to assess solar potential and information about currently installed solar systems. The pan and zoom operators, permits users to move around the subject area. Finally, an calculate operator is automatically executed in every map at loading time as it performs computations of built-in algorithm in order to generate useful information based on current statistics collected.

                         <h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
                         <p>3D CityGML models are commonly used for applications which require 3D mapping, realistic simulation, better visualization and analysis. The model mostly consists of polygons as the surface either faÃ§ade, roof or more details building assessor such as balcony, doors and furniture. (Ismail B. 2017) Unity is a cross-platform game engine normally used to develop 2D or/and 3D video games and simulations for computers, virtual reality, consoles and mobile devices platform (Unity, 2017). It is commercial software developed by Unity Technologies.  3D Unity engine capable of making high quality games, design and develop 3D social network gaming platforms (Bae and Kim, 2014).  Besides that, 3D visualization, functions and attributes, intelligence and metric measurements can be done with Unity 3D encoding. In addition, a choice either to use their libraries or our own codes for supporting application analysis. </p>

                         <h3>Skills Required</h3>
                         <p>Unity web developer requires excellent knowledge of Unity, including experience with scripting, textures, animation, GUI styles, and user session management. A Unity developer will sometimes focus fully on the design and more artistic while sometimes they focus fully on the coding. The good thing would be a middle ground. To create complex projects, coding skills need to be absolute (C#, UnityScript, Boo). In order to keep track with the current updates, unity developers need to brush up on the latest coding practices within the gaming industry. In addition, having a strong visual sense is also a credit as being able to produce stunning interactive graphics is an especially important skill to have as a Unity Developer. On the other hand, CityGML requires user to have high-level of 3D visualization and logic skills. Since CityGML is a  an open data model and XML-based format for the storage and exchange of virtual 3D city models, developers are expected to have advance geometry understanding and XML coding experience.</p>

                         <h3>Outcome</h3>
                         <p>Rooftop PV systems have become popular ways for energy consumers to become energy producers. Individuals and societies are blessed with exciting economic and environmental opportunities respectively throughout this project. Unlike other types of energy, solar being a unique resource energy of being spatially dispersed and micro-scalable allows for production of energy in the locations that use it most. In addition, it provides a wealth of mapping opportunities for cartographers and GIScientists. Mapping the spatial distribution of solar benefits cartographers, but we are no longer limited to a static and simple representation of solar potential with the advent of interactive web maps. Indeed, users are given the opportunities to explore the map in ways that may influence their decision making.</p>
